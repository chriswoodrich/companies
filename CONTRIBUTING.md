## Requirements for a successful addition

  ```
* Include a very brief description of what your company does.
* Separate the company name/link and description with a vertical pipe character (`|`) to keep the table formatted correctly.

## Appearing on Lita.io

Please note that any company added to this list may be chosen to appear on [Lita.io](https://www.lita.io/) as an example of a company using Lita. If you are chosen, your company name (and logo, if one is available via your website) will be displayed, but not the provided description of the company.
